Burger Of The Day: A fun RIA project using the JavaScript Fetch API to reference the Bob's Burgers REST/GraphQL API. Filtered to randomly display, on page load/refresh, a different burger of the day featured in every episode from seasons 2 and 3, as well as a scrolling background image gallery of some pics from the tv show.
